## NPC Architect (PF2e)

**NPC Architect** is a high-performance creation suite for Foundry VTT (PF2e) that leverages Gemini AI to bridge the gap between imagination and mechanical execution. It features native support for the World of Greyhawk.

⚔️ **Core Capabilities**
**Universal Stat Block Generation**: Create a complete, mechanically sound PF2e NPC or Monster from a simple description (e.g., "A mutated displacer beast from the Barrier Peaks").

**Cross-System Conversion:** Paste a stat block from any TTRPG system (5e, AD&D, etc.) and instantly translate it into a fully functional PF2e Actor.

**Greyhawk Integration**: Native support for Greyhawk-specific ancestries and social backgrounds, ensuring your NPCs are setting-accurate.

**AI Drafting**: Refine personality, quirks, and mannerisms using the "Draft" feature before final creation.
